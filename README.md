# Clustering

Description:

This project focuses on customer segmentation and clustering using the K-means algorithm, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique. The goal is to analyze customer data and group customers into distinct clusters based on their similarities in purchasing behavior.

Key Features:

1.Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess customer data to ensure quality input for clustering.
2.Feature Selection: Identify relevant features (such as purchase history, demographics) for clustering.
3.K-means Clustering: Implement the K-means algorithm to partition customers into clusters.
4.Visualization: Visualize clustering results using 2D and 3D plots to understand customer segments.
5.Interpretation: Analyze and interpret clusters to derive meaningful insights about customer groups.
6.Scalability: Design the solution to handle large datasets efficiently for real-world applications.
7.Performance Evaluation: Evaluate clustering performance using metrics like silhouette score or inertia.
